Shake me into the night
And I'm an easy lover
Take me into the fight
And I'm an easy brother
And I'm on fire

Burn my sweet effigy
I'm a road runner
Spill my guts on a wheel
I wanna taste uh-huh
And I'm on fire
And I'm on fire

And I'm on fire
I'm on fire
Whoo Whoo
Whoo Whoo

Wire me up to machines
I'll be your prisoner
Find it hard to believe
You are my murderer
I'm on fire behind you
Heads a fallen sky

I'm on fire
I'm on fire
Whoo Whoo
Whoo Whoo

I'm on fire
I'm on fire
Whoo Whoo
Whoo Whoo
